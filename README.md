# CS559-Framework
Empty repo as a reminder about the CS559 framework

This is where you would expect to find the CS559 Framework code. However, for various reasons it is better to have a new repo each year.

Please look at the specific repo for the year you are interested in (e.g., [CS559/Framework22](https://github.com/CS559/CS559-Framework22))

Note: most of the annual repos build the documentation automatically and publish them on GitHub Pages (see [the 2022 Documentation](https://cs559.github.io/CS559-Framework22/))
